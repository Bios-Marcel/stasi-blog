## Using GitHub to host your blog

The service [GitHub](https://github.com) allows you to host a static website.
The site can either be delivered as markdown (.md) documents or plain HTML.
This blog generator creates plain HTML, meaning you can just upload the result
to your GitHub reppository and your blog will be online.

First, you'll have to [make a new GitHub repository](https://github.com/new).

The repository should be public and has to be named `yourusername.github.io`.
Here you simply replace `yourusername` with whatever your GitHub username
is. For me for example, it would be `Bios-Marcel.github.io`.
If you choose any name that differs from your account name, GitHub will instead
setup a sub page, using the same address. For example if you'd name your
repository `blog`, then the URL would be `https://yourusername.github.io/blog`.

Next, you'll need to setup the "blog writing environment" on your computer.

Open a terminal and execute the following:

```sh
cd ~/Documents/
mkdir blog-source
cd blog-source
```

If you want your blog files to reside somewhere else, simply change the
`cd ~/Documents/` line to some other folder. The shortcut `~` is your
system users home directory.

Next, you need to copy the `example` directory into your newly
created `blog-source` directory as a. Rename the directory from `example`
to `source`.

Now, if you didn't name your repository as has been suggested earlier on,
you'll have to edit your configuration to look like this:

```json
{
    "BasePath": "repository-name",
    "SiteName":"Blog name",
    "Author":"Your name",
    "Description":"A blog about things",
    "URL":"https://yourusername.github.io/",
    "CreationDate":"2021-02-28T00:00:00+00:00",
    "AddOptionalMetaData": true
}
```

You'll have to replace the `repository-name` with whatever you named the
repository. While you are at it, you can also change the other settings to
whatever you desire.

For a full explanation of the `config.json` file, see [The config.json](/the-config.json)

Lastly, you'll need to put the `stasi-blog` executable into that same folder.

So the structure of that folder should now look like this:

```plain
|--source
   |--media
      |--kaito-kid.png
   |--pages
      |--about.html
   |--articles
      |--kaito.html
   |--config.json
   |--favicon.ico
   |--README.md
stasi-blog(.exe)
```

Next you `build` your blog, by running:

```sh
stasi-blog build -o "./" source
```

And then `serve` a test version on your computer by running:

```sh
stasi-blog serve ./
```

The tool will now show at the URL at which you can see the webpage in your
browser.

### Uploading your page to GitHub

## Writing an article

Articles are currently written with plain HTML and require some meta
information. The metadata uses YAML and is separated from the page content by a
single line containing only `---`. A document for an article should look like
this:

```
title:Clickbait Title
description: My thoughts on X.
date: 2020-12-10
tags: [categoryA,category]
---
<p>TEXT</p>
```

The sections `tags` and `description` are optional.

However, even though the `content` section is HTML, you don't need to write
a full web page. Instead, just write the text you'd normally want to see in
the content section of your article. While you usually start with a
heading, this can be omitted, as the heading is auto-generated by using the
`title` data.

## Writing a custom page

Writing a custom page is similar to writing an article, the only difference
is, that you only require the sections `title` and `content`.

Meaning, that this would be enough already:

```
title: Custom Page Name
---
<p>TEXT</p>
```

## Tables with a rowhreader

Usually a table is divided into rows and columns, where each column has a
header and each row holds data. However, there are scenarios where you want
a table to have both a column header and a row header. You can do this using
the `trh-table` style class. An example would be:

```html
<p>Opening times</p>

<table class="trh-table">
    <!--Column headers-->
    <tr>
        <!--Left empty as this cell isn't meant to be used.-->
        <th></th>
        <th>Monday</th>
        <th>Tuesday</th>
        <th>Wednesday</th>
        <th>Thursday</th>
        <th>Friday</th>
    </tr>
    <!--Beginning of data-->
    <tr>
        <!-- Rowheader cell-->
        <td>09:00 - 13:00</td>
        <!-- Data cells-->
        <td>Open</td>
        <td>Open</td>
        <td>Open</td>
        <td>Open</td>
        <td>Open</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <!-- Rowheader cell-->
        <td>13:00 - 14:00</td>
        <!-- Data cells-->
        <td>Closed</td>
        <td>Closed</td>
        <td>Closed</td>
        <td>Closed</td>
        <td>Closed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <!-- Rowheader cell-->
        <td>14:00 - 18:00</td>
        <!-- Data cells-->
        <td>Open</td>
        <td>Open</td>
        <td>Open</td>
        <td>Open</td>
        <td>Closed</td>
    </tr>
</table>
```

## Best practices

### Headings

For headings, you should use standard HTML tags `h1` to `h6`. Note, that each
page, whether article or custom page, will automatically render the page title
as an `h1` heading. Therefore all content headings should be `h2` or smaller.

If you use headings in your HTML, they will automatically be augmented with an
anchor (`a`) to allow jumping directly to a heading.

### Image loading

If you want to add images to your posts, try loading them lazily, as it
allows your readers to get a readable page faster. Especially on mobile
devices, old computers or devices with a slow internet connection, this
can really help.

To lazily load an image, you need the `loading="lazy"` attribute.

An example could look like this:

```html
<img src="/images/postA/house.png" loading="lazy" alt="My new house"/>
```

### Avoid unnecessary load

Each font, script, image, video, audio file or whatever you add to your
page will cause higher load times and potentially data usage, which can
potentially even cost your user more money.

By default all fonts are default fonts and no images are used, not even
a favicon.
