## Writing an article

Articles are currently written with plain HTML and require some meta
information. A document for an article should look like this:

```
{{define "title"}}Clickbait Title{{end}}
{{define "description"}}My thoughts on X.{{end}}
{{define "date"}}2020-12-10{{end}}
{{define "tags"}}categoryA,categoryB{{end}}
{{define "content"}}<p>TEXT</p>{{end}}
```

The sections `tags` and `description` are optional.

However, even though the `content` section is HTML, you don't need to write
a full web page. Instead, just write the text you'd normally want to see in
the content section of your article. While you usually start with a
heading, this can be omitted, as the heading is auto-generated by using the
`title` data.

## Writing a custom page

Writing a custom page is similar to writing an article, the only difference
is, that you only require the sections `title` and `content`.

Meaning, that this would be enough already:

```
{{define "title"}}Custom Page Name{{end}}
{{define "content"}}<p>TEXT</p>{{end}}
```

## Best practices

### Image loading

If you want to add images to your posts, try loading them lazily, as it
allows your readers to get a readable page faster. Especially on mobile
devices, old computers or devices with a slow internet connection, this
can really help.

To lazily load an image, you need the `loading="lazy"` attribute.

An example could look like this:

```html
<img src="/images/postA/house.png" loading="lazy" alt="My new house"/>
```

### Avoid unnecessary load

Each font, script, image, video, audio file or whatever you add to your
page will cause higher load times and potentially data usage, which can
potentially even cost your user more money.

By default all fonts are default fonts and no images are used, not even
a favicon.
