<p>Kaito Kid is an anime about a guy named Kaito Kuroba.</p>

<p>He wears white clothing and his most notable accessories are a cylinder and a monocle.</p>

<h2>Genre</h2>

<p>The anime somewhat follows the monster of the day principle, but with crimes.
    In each episode Kaito steals something in a very sneaky way using tricks and "magic".</p>

<h2>Other Heading</h2>

<p>It's quite a funny anime and I can recommend it especially for young people.</p>

<p>If you are older, you might have already heard of Kaito, as he's a character
    from the Detective Conan series.</p>
