# Example

This is a minimal example of a functioning blog using stasi-blog.

To execute the example run:

```shell
./stasi-blog build ./example --output="example-output"
./stasi-blog serve ./example-output
```

If you don't have an executable yet, you can run the code directly by
replacing `./stasi-blog` with `go run .`. You need to have the Go
programming language in version 1.16 or newer installed.
